## HOW DOES WE DEFINE VERSIONS?
The first number __(major version)__ usually indicates major changes
in the program that may lead to incompatibility with the previous version. 
Thus, if a major change has occurred that requires, for example, rewriting
a significant part of the code, this can be indicated by increasing the first digit.

The second number __(minor version)__ usually indicates the introduction of new functions
into the program that do not violate compatibility with the previous version. 
If new features have been added to the program, but no significant changes have been made, 
then this may be indicated by an increase in the second digit.

The third number __(patchversion)__ usually indicates the correction of errors and other problems
in the program without adding new functions. If some problem has been fixed, then it can be
indicated by increasing the third digit.
